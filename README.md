# CS_370_Current_And_Emerging_Trends_In_CS

- Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
-         When given this project I was provided with a large portion of starting code. This consisted of the libraries to import, the maze matrix and layout, code to draw the maze, and the neural network model. The code that I supplied for this project is under the TODO: section of the ipybn file. This section consists of the necessary code in order for the agent to learn.


- Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
        What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
        How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
        What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
