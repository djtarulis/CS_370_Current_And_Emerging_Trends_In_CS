# CS_370_Current_And_Emerging_Trends_In_CS

- Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
-         When given this project I was provided with a large portion of starting code. This consisted of the libraries to import, the maze matrix and layout, code to draw the maze, and the neural network model. The code that I supplied for this project is under the TODO: section of the ipybn file. This section consists of the Q-training algorithm necessary in order for the agent to learn and achieve a 100% success rate.

- Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
- 
        What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
          - Computer scientists solve problems. We are in the era of technology that impacts almost every aspect of everyday life. It is a computer scientists job to analyze the impact that technology has on their environment whether it be for a specific industry or society as a whole.
        How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
          - I always approach problems in the same way. Gather resources and information on the problem before starting any kind of work or coding. This approach has always been my preferred one and I believe it help with effeciency and retention of what is learned.
        What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
          - My ethical responsibilities should always consider the health and safety of the end user as well as the organization. Sometimes these two may clash and a tough decision must be made. In that case the end user and general people come first.
